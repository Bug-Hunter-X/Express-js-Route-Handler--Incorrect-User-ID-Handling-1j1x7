# Express.js Route Handler: Incorrect User ID Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: incorrect handling of non-numeric user IDs. The original code assumes the user ID is always numeric, which can lead to unexpected errors or vulnerabilities.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to handle this issue correctly. 

## Bug:

The original code fails to correctly handle non-numeric user IDs.  This can result in database errors or unexpected behavior.  It is crucial for robustness to validate and sanitize user inputs.

## Solution:

The solution involves explicitly validating and sanitizing the user ID before using it in database queries. By parsing the ID to a number and handling non-numeric inputs gracefully, the risk of errors and vulnerabilities is significantly reduced.
